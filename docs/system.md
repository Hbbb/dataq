# DataQ System Design

## Overview
DataQ is a plugin-based data archival and organization system designed to collect, process, and store data from various sources in a unified way. The system follows a modular architecture that allows easy extension through plugins while maintaining a consistent interface for data extraction and processing.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Plugin System**
   - Plugin Registry: Manages plugin registration and lifecycle
   - Plugin Interface: Defines standard methods for data extraction
   - Plugin Runner: Executes plugins and handles their responses

2. **Data Model**
   - DataItem: Represents extracted data with metadata
   - PluginRequest/Response: Handles communication with plugins
   - Configuration: Manages system and plugin settings

3. **Plugin Communication Protocol**
   - Uses Protocol Buffers for structured data exchange
   - Standardized request/response format
   - Support for streaming data extraction

### Plugin Architecture

Each plugin implements the following interface:
- ID(): Unique identifier
- Name(): Human-readable name
- Description(): Plugin functionality description
- Configure(): Setup with plugin-specific settings
- Extract(): Data extraction implementation

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration Phase**
   - System loads configuration from YAML file
   - Plugins are initialized with their specific settings
   - Plugin registry maintains active plugin instances

2. **Extraction Phase**
   - System iterates through enabled plugins
   - Each plugin receives extraction request
   - Plugins stream DataItems back to core system
   - Data items are processed and stored as needed

3. **Plugin Communication**
   - Plugins run as separate processes
   - Communication via stdin/stdout using Protocol Buffers
   - Support for async streaming of large datasets

## Built-in Plugins

1. **File Scanner Plugin**
   - Scans local filesystem
   - Configurable file patterns
   - Extracts file metadata and content

2. **Gmail Plugin**
   - OAuth2 authentication
   - Email metadata extraction
   - Configurable email filtering

## Extensibility

The system is designed for easy extension through:
1. New plugin development
2. Custom data processors
4. Enhanced metadata extraction

## Configuration Management

- YAML-based configuration
- Plugin-specific settings

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Parallel plugin execution
   - Distributed data processing
   - Cloud storage integration

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Real-time data monitoring
   - Data transformation pipeline
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Data deduplication

3. **Integration**
   - API endpoints
   - Event-driven architecture
   - External service webhooks
